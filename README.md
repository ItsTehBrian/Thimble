# MavenTehPlugin
Boilerplate code for any Spigot-based plugin, built with Maven.

If you're looking for one built with Gradle, [click here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/GradleTehPlugin).

## How do I use it for myself?
First, you're going to want a fresh copy of this repository.

1. `cd SomeDirectory`
2. `git clone https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/MavenTehPlugin`
3. `cd MavenTehPlugin`
4. `rm -rf .git`
5. `rm LICENSE` (Please add your own license.)
6. `git init` (**Optional.**)

Now that you have a clean copy of this repository without any old git
history, I recommend you start by editing pom.xml with all of your information
instead of mine.

Anywhere that you see my name or domain, just edit it out with *your* name
or domain. For example, change `src/main/java/xyz/tehbrian/maventehplugin`
to something more like `src/main/java/com/yourdomain/yourpluginname`.

All the code is located in `src/main`. Go nuts!

## Can you help me? It's not working.
Yeah, sure! You can find me at [my Discord](https://tehbrian.xyz/discord).
Just ping me (`@TehBrian`) and I'll try to get to you as soon as I can.
